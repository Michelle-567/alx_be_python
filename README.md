# 🗓️ Michelle's Monthly Worklog – *June 2025*

## 📌 Summary of What I Worked On
Over the past month, I’ve focused on strengthening my Python programming skills by diving into advanced concepts and programming paradigms. Topics I covered include:

- ✅ Functions and code reusability
- ✅ Core data structures and working with Python modules
- ✅ Understanding programming paradigms with emphasis on OOP
- ✅ Advanced Python classes and objects
- ✅ Inheritance, polymorphism, and duck typing
- ✅ Deep dive into @classmethod and @staticmethod
- ✅ Serialization and deserialization (storing & loading structured data)

---

## 🌟 Achievements
- Completed multiple real-world assignments involving object-oriented design
- Practiced creating flexible, maintainable code using inheritance and composition
- Built class-based systems using both class and static methods appropriately
- Implemented polymorphic behavior using duck typing
- Applied serialization for basic data persistence (e.g., JSON and pickle)

---

## 🔍 Learnings from Failures & Challenges
- ❌ Initially misunderstood how polymorphism and method overriding work — fixed through consistent practice
- ❌ Confused function references (`func`) vs function calls (`func()`) — resolved with better debugging
- ❌ Faced issues with decorator usage (@staticmethod vs @classmethod) — learned through side-by-side examples
- ❌ Serialization was confusing at first — overcame this by breaking it into small experiments

---

## ✨ Monthly Highlights
- 💡 “Aha” moment realizing that duck typing makes code extremely flexible
- 🧠 Confidently created classes that interact using inheritance
- 🔁 Got comfortable organizing code into modules and reusable functions
- 🔄 Started thinking in terms of structure and readability, not just getting things to work
- 📘 Completed several tasks that brought all these concepts together in real, testable code

> 🧭 *Every bug, error, and confusion taught me something valuable. This month has pushed me to grow, debug smarter, and think like a real developer.*  
> I’m now more confident in writing modular, object-oriented Python code, and ready to move forward into more complex topics and projects.
